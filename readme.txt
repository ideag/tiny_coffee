A WordPress donate button plugin with a twist - ask your supporters to treat you to a coffee, beer or other beverage of your choice.

An enormous amount of coffee was consumed while developing these plugins, so if you like what you get, please consider treating me to a [cup](http://arunas.co/#coffee). Or two. Or ten.

Also, try out my other plugins:

* [Gust](http://tiny.lt/gust) - a Ghost-like admin panel for WordPress, featuring Markdown based split-view editor.

* [tinyTOC](http://tiny.lt/tinytoc) - automatic Table of Contents, based on H1-H6 headings in post content.
* [tinyIP](http://tiny.lt/tinyip) - *Premium* - stop WordPress users from sharing login information, force users to be logged in only from one device at a time.
